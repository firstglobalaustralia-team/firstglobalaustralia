Team Australia — FIRST Global Challenge 2025

💙 We Love Everything About FIRST

We are a community-based team made up of passionate students from 20 different schools across Sydney, united by our shared love for robotics. 
Unlike many school-based teams, we don't have a permanent lab or workshop of our own. 
Every weekend, we gather at the Gladesville Library, transforming a small meeting room into our training space. 
When the session ends, we pack away motors, laptops and dreams alike, leaving the space as we found it — ready for the next user.

But no matter where we come from, we all show up — because our team isn't built on convenience, but on commitment.
Some of our teammates travel up to 1.5 hours each way to attend our meetings. 
Our coach loads the car with heavy crates of parts, tools and inspiration. 
It’s not always easy, but we never lose sight of why we do it — because robotics isn’t just a hobby to us.
It is a team sport, and that drives us to push through every challenge and race to the finish line.

🔩 From Rookie to Resilient

We embarked on our FIRST journey years ago as FIRST LEGO League Team 1585, when our rookie season ended in complete defeat.
But rather than give up, we learned from our experience. 
It led us to build flljourney.org, a website created to help new teams learn from the challenges we once faced. 
Today, that project has reached over 70,000 views, indicating that even small teams can make a lasting impact.

Later, we founded FTC Team 24961 and began competing in Australia in 2023. 
Our rookie season concluded with 1 win and 4 losses; the following year, we improved to 2 wins and 3 losses. 
Although we haven't reached the national finals yet, we are proud of every small step. 

In a broader scope, we’re still rookies — still learning and continuously improving.
And we’re proud of that, because every great team starts small.
In robotics, failure isn’t something to fear. It’s the first step toward something greater.

🤖 The FGC Journey — Sharing What We Learn

But more than competing, what excites us most is passing on what we’ve learned to other teams and empowering them to begin their journey.
In 2025, we were honoured to represent Team Australia at the FIRST Global Challenge.
This opportunity inspired us to create FGC 101, a video series recorded from our rookie perspective — covering everything from building and coding to teamwork and storytelling.
Our mission is simple: to help future teams learn faster.
Through FGC 101, we want every team to know that even without fancy facilities, building something incredible is within reach.

As we approach Episode 51, we're launching our new domain — fgc101.org — and expanding our resources to include open-source code on GitHub and Onshape CAD models.
We hope these resources will encourage teams around the world to start, fail, learn and grow — just like we did.

🌏 Looking Beyond Australia

As we grow, our mission has expanded beyond our own team — to support and inspire others across the region.
The FIRST Global Challenge has now reached more than 200 countries and regions. 
Yet some parts of Oceania — like New Zealand and several Pacific nations — still don’t have official teams.
We're ready to welcome and support these future teams by sharing our knowledge, experience and passion for robotics.
If you’re ready to begin, we’ll be there to help.

Because FIRST taught us something important:
“The power of robotics isn’t in winning. It’s in inspiring others to start their own journey.”

💬 Motto

“We don’t have a lab. But we have each other — and that’s enough to build something extraordinary.”
